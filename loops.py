statement = "Hello world!"
# Lets print a statement 10x 

# Using a While loop:
# i = 0
# while i < 10: 
#     print(statement)
#     i += 1

# # Using a for loop
# for i in range(0, 10):
#     print(i + 1, ":", statement)


# Lets take user input to know how many times we should repeat our statement:
# repeat = int(input("How many times should we repeat our statement: "))
# for i in range(0, repeat):
#     print(i + 1, ":", statement)
